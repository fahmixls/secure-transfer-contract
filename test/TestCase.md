Additional Notes

Setup: Deploy the contract with a mock ERC20 token, set initial supported tokens, and fund test accounts (sender, recipient, feeCollector).
Time Manipulation: Use a testing framework to manipulate block.timestamp for expiry-related tests.
Transfer ID Uniqueness: Verify transferNonce increments and ensures unique transferId values.
Reentrancy: Basic reentrancy protection is provided by ReentrancyGuard, but additional stress tests could be added if needed.

This test suite ensures the SecureTransferLink contract is robust, secure, and functions as intended across all scenarios.
